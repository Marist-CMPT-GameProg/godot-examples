class_name MeleeAttack
extends Attack
## Derived attack class for close-quarters, hand-held attacks

# TODO Implement this derived class after implementing the base Attack class
#    For now, this class doesn't need to do anything except make sure that
#    the base class _ready function is called.
# TODO Also create a new MeleeAttack prefab scene that has a collision shape and a
#    sprite as child nodes.
