class_name RangeAttack
extends Attack
## Derived attack class for projectile-based attacks from distance

# TODO Implement this derived class after implementing the base Attack class
#    Ranged attacks should have a speed configurable in the Inspector.
#    They must also keep track of the initial/launch position and velocity
#    of the projectile. A constructor should initialize these properties and
#    the projectile position must be updated every physics tick.
# TODO Also create a new RangeAttack prefab scene that has collision shape,
#    sprite, and visibility-on-screen-notifier child nodes.
